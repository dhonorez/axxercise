# General assessment for Axxes Candidates.

Hi,

If you made it to this page, it means you're probably a candidate for [Axxes](https://axxes.com) or [AT Recruitment](https://atrecruitment.be).

1. Write a program that reads and prints the contents of the file "windows-1252.txt". 
2. Write a program that reads the contents of colleagues.txt, maps it to objects, and stores it in a collection that maintains the order. The fields are: id, lastname, firstname and birthdate.
3. Write a program that sorts the list in alphabetical order (first on lastname, then on firstname).
4. Write a program that prints every object to system out.

# BONUS

5. Extend program 3, but print the entries in random order.
6. Extend again, this time making the program multithreaded. 

2017 - Axxes.
